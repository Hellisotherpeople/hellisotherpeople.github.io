<center><h2>About me</h2></center>

<p> I was awarded a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Oregon in 2018.</p>
<br>
<p> I have a really cute cat, here's a pic of him: <img src="2.jpg" height="120" width="170" style="float:middle;vertical-align:middle"> </p>
<br>
<p> In my free time, I like to do the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Swim and Run</li>
    <li>Play Cello</li>
    <li>Read and study  Philosophy</li>
    <li>Coach the local high school Debate team</li>
    <li>Play Video Games (especially League of Legends)</li>
</ul>
<p> Other places that I've worked at include: </p>
<center><h2>What's up with this website?</h2></center>
<p>My previous portfolio website was a mess. I used a bloated template which relied on tons of libraries for various "pretty" but ultimately superflous effects. A portfolio website shouldn't have to deal with bugs related to the ~5mb of javascript libraries that I'm importing for it. Given that this is a static site, I felt no need to use <dfn>any</dfn> JS. A clean, simple website like this is part of my attempt to move towards elegance and minimalism with my workflow. 
<p>Yes, with only plain HTML/CSS, a website can look clean, crisp, and can render on all devices properly. It's also going to be blazing fast, and won't waste the precious cache space of my readers.

<p>An excerpt from the <a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website/"> this portfolios inspirtation</a> explaining my rationale
<blockquote><dfn>"You do it every day. You take <a title="Motherfucking Website" href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">a masterpiece</a> and incrementally <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com" title="Better Motherfucking Website">ruin it</a> for the sake of design. Let me remind you: design isto plan and make something for a specific purpose. The most basic purpose of text on a website is to be read. Yet you keep doing shit that gets in the way."</dfn></blockquote>

<p>and another good quote, from an article critiquing the <a href="https://pxlnv.com/blog/bullshit-web/">"Bullshit Web"</a>
<blockquote><dfn>"It’s key to recognize, though, that this is a choice, a responsibility, and — ultimately — a matter of respect. Let us return to Graeber’s explanation of bullshit jobs, and his observation that we often experience fifteen-hour work weeks while at the office for forty. Much of the same is true on the web: there is the capability for pages to load in a second or two, but it has instead been used to spy on users’ browsing habits, make them miserable, and inundate them on other websites and in their inbox."</dfn></blockquote>
